# :memo:Assignment 3
- Here I created `Merge Conflicts` and resolved them.

## GITHUB Repository
https://github.com/MidhileshP-minfy/Merge-Conflict
## Created a `HTML` file and wrote a basic code

## Created two branches `feature/update-styling` and `feature/add-content`
- Made different changes in them and commited them to GitHub Repository

## Tried to Merge them and Conflicts Appeared
